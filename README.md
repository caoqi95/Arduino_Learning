# Arduino_Learning
有些是练习过官网 Tutorial 里 Bulit-in Examples 中的简单例子后，按照自己的理解及思路编写的代码；有些是自己找的例子，然后自己实现的代码。并没有完整覆盖官网的全部示例，因为缺少一些元器件。


### Digital

+ State Change Detection：Count the number of button pushes.
+ DigitalWriteLed


### Analog

+ Calibration: Define a maximum and minimum for expected analog sensor values.
+ Fading: Use an analog output (PWM pin) to fade an LED.


### Communication

+ Physical Pixel: Turn a LED on and off by sending data to your Arduino.
+ Read ASCII String: Parse a comma-separated string of integers to fade an LED.

### Control Structures
+ Arrays: A variation on the For Loop example that demonstrates how to use an array.
+ Switch Case: How to choose between a discrete number of values.
+ Switch Case 2: A second switch-case example, showing how to take different actions based on the characters received in the serial port.


### Digtial Tube
+ Single DigitalTube: Drive a digital tube with common anode, display Numbers 0~9.
+ Random Dice: Generate a number randomly.
+ Using SevSeg: Use SevSeg library and Photoresistor to drive a digital tube.
+ Four Digits：Driver four digital tubes to display numbers.
+ Timer：Make a timer using TimerOne library.

### Display
+ 1602 LCD:  Use 1602 LCD to display "Hello, World!" and run time.

### Sensors
+ DHC：Use humidity sensor to detect humidity and temperature.

### Projects
+ DetectHT：Detect the humidity and temperature and display it on the LCD.
+ SimpleClock：Use RTC module to make a simple clock.
+ MeatureDistance：Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and display it on the LCD. Give an alarm when the distance is less than 20cm.
+ MeatureDistance2.0：Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and display it on the LCD. When the distance is less than 20, send out an alarm and turn on the light.
